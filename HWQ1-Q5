// AppWorks School Homework of Android - Week 3

Q1. What is​Encapsulation? Try to list out the benefits of Encapsulation.
-> Encapsulation is to wrap variables, methods or classes and prevent them from being called or
   modified by unwanted objects. By this, the role of the objects are clarified to other objects,
   and also prevent unwanted access by client.
   The benefits of Encapsulation are
   1. Making the code more readable.
   2. Simplify the maintenance of the code.
   3. Making data safer.


Q2. Try to explain what is​enum and why we use them.
-> Some type of objects have only certain values, and enum class can be implement here.  It also
   provides a type-safe enum so no other value can be assigned.


Q3. How to use​enum in Kotlin? Attach a sample code that use enum in Kotlin.
-> Enums are instance in a Enum class and can take properties in Enum class.
   Example:

    enum class DAYS(val isWeekend: Boolean = false){
        SUNDAY(true),
        MONDAY,
        TUESDAY,
        WEDNESDAY,
        THURSDAY,
        FRIDAY,
        SATURDAY(true);
        {


Q4. What are the​differences between​LinearLayout and​RelativeLayout​? Try to explain in details.
-> Layout: LinearLayout provides alignment in vertical or horizontal orientation, child-views are
   displayed one after another with the provided orientation.

   RelativeLayout on the other hand, provide a more flexible positioning by assigning the relative
   position of two views.


Q5. Try to explain the benefits of​ConstraintLayout. Why you should use it?
-> With ConstraintLayout, a complex layout can be achieved with lesser viewgroup by creating a flat
   view hierarchy, resulting improving the performance.
